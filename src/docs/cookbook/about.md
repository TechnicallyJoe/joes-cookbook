## What is it?

This is Joes Cookbook!

The goal here is simple: to provide a centralized repository for small, easy-to-use, DevOps-centric, scripts and templates that fulfill a specific goal. To provide a few examples of this, see [this](/docs/azuredevops/multi-stage-pipelines) and [this](/docs/azuredevops/pipeline-linting).
